# Research Paper: Debiasing Word Embeddings

This [research paper on strategies to debias word embeddings](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6228-man-is-to-computer-programmer-as-woman-is-to-homemaker-debiasing-word-embeddings.pdf) gives a great look at how researchers are building adversarial models to increase fairness in large real-life datasets. 

While the paper is dense and contains a lot of terms we aren't yet familiar with, it's pretty easy to get through the first paragraph of each section to get an idea of the real-world efforts to debias machine learning.
