# The Equality Conundrum

This [New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/13/the-equality-conundrum) gives us deep insight into the challenge of defining equality. It's helpful to grasp the philosophical arguments for equality in society as we apply some of the same concepts to machine learning. 

While reading this [article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/13/the-equality-conundrum), keep in the mind the following questions:

1) The article raises the scenario of dividing assets amongst children by either "equality of resources" or "equality of welfare'" - which of these do you find yourself leaning toward as the more fair definition? Why might that be?

2) How we can apply some of the philosophical arguments present in this article toward how we approach machine learning?
